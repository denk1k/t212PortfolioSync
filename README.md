## ‚ú® Features

*   **Simple installation**: Get up and running in a few clicks.
*   **Works in the background**: The extension handles all operations without interrupting your workflow.
*   **Precise allocation matching**: Uses both BUY and SELL orders to match your target allocations as closely as possible.
*   **Tested**: The logic has been tested on accounts with a large number of positions.
*   **Versatile**: Useful for traders who want to sync their portfolios to predetermined allocations, such as copying a hedge fund's latest known open positions.
*   **Secure**: No need to enter T212 credentials. The extension uses the authentication already present in your browser.
*   **Resilient**: Less prone to breaking from website updates, as it uses reverse-engineered T212 APIs instead of UI scraping.
*   **Customizable**: The code is intentionally kept simple so anyone can modify it to their needs.

## üìù Future Plans
