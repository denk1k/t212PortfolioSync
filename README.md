# t212PortfolioSync

A Chrome extension that syncs your demo/live Trading 212 portfolio to allocations defined in a CSV file.

## ‚ú® Features
*   **Live**: Works in live accounts unlike the T212 Public API.
*   **Resilient**: Less prone to breaking from website updates, as it uses various reverse-engineered T212 APIs, such as the order, order property, and account endpoints, as well as Algolia ticker searching endpoints in the event that a ticker does not match the T212 API's standards.
*   **Easy to use**: Just import the CSV file and click the "Rebalance" button. The tickers will be automatically mapped.
*   **Simple installation**: Get up and running in a few clicks.
*   **Works in the background**: The extension handles all operations without interrupting your workflow.
*   **Precise allocation matching**: Uses both BUY and SELL orders to match your target allocations as closely as possible.
*   **Safe**: No unwanted interactions with existing equity allocations in pies.
*   **Tested**: The logic has been tested on accounts with a large number of positions.
*   **Secure**: No need to enter T212 credentials. The extension uses the authentication already present in your browser.
*   **Customizable**: The code is intentionally kept simple so anyone can modify it to their needs.
*   **Free**: No ads, no tracking, no data collection.

## üìù The CSV File
The CSV should have two columns, first column containing the name of the ticker and the second one containing the target allocation in decimals.
Ticker name can be both the full company name, the shorthand name or the API name, so all of these would work:
```csv
Apple,0.2
MSFT_US_EQ,0.2
AMZN,0.2
```
It is, however, more efficient if the direct API name is used as then the need for Algolia API calls is alleviated.

## üìù Future Plans

-   [ ] **Important:** Implement a more comprehensive retry mechanism for failed API requests.
-   [ ] **Important:** Implement using non-value sell orders to include them in rebalancing calculations.
-   [ ] **Mild:** Add a check to see if positions can be modified before placing orders and show the status to the user.
-   [ ] **Mild:** Should add an option to pick a stock into which the money that was impossible to invest into the allocations due to minimum order quantity, would be automatically invested into.
-   [ ] **Mild:** Develop a Python interop extension to allow for a true algorithmic trading experience.
-   [x] **Mild:** Allow the user to enter common stock tickers (e.g., AAPL, MSFT), which the script would then resolve to the correct T212 instrument code using public APIs.
-   [ ] **Mild:** Create a better notification tray where the user can see any failed orders at a glance.
-   [ ] **Mild:** Enable Crypto trading.
